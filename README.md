# Learn pytorch
Some coding example to start playing around with PyTorch. 
The examples come from the [learnpython](https://www.learnpytorch.io/03_pytorch_computer_vision/) website. 

## ToDo
Check pytorch documentation on: 
* model
* loss function
* optimizer and the way they interact with each other
* max pool
